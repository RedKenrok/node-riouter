# Riouter

Alternative RiotJS router. Do note this package has not been battle tested yet, however feel free to help improve the package by testing it and providing feedback or reporting any issues you come across.

## Differences with [riot/route](https://github.com/riot/route)

- Riouter can have multiple router instances on a single page. Even a router within a route is possible.
- Riouter can control whether the browsers session history is changed by the router.
- Riouter does not have a `initDomListeners` method. (It is trivial to write a solution yourself, see the example directory's `app.html`.)

## Install

npm install riouter
